# Day 1 — Band Name Generator

A tiny CLI program that asks for a city and a pet name and prints a band name.

## Notes
- Python is indentation-sensitive (whitespace matters).
- `print()` and `input(prompt)` make quick CLI programs really concise.
- Variables are dynamically typed (you don’t declare a type up front).

## Run
From the repo root:

```bash
python day01/main.py
```
