# Day 1 - Band Name Generator
Notes:
-Spaces and indentations matter compared to other languages(i.e. JAVA and JavaScript)

-Pythons concise handling of print, input(prompt), and final output in one line is unique compared to my experiences with other languages.

-Variable declaration is more simplistic, ability to create a variable without type 

## Run
```bash
python main.py
