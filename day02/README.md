#Day 2 - Tip Calculator

Notes for the day:
-for human readability numbers can be written with underscores where we would normally place commas for example, 1,000,000 or 1 million would be 1_000_000

-Maths Operations include ** which is a baked in exponent for python as well as // which does division like / but returns an int instead of a float and removes all numbers after the decimal it does not round properly but just removes the decimal(floors the number)

-f-strings are a handy tool to insert variables with different types into a string


## Run
```bash
python ./main.py
