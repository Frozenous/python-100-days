# Day 2 - Tip Calculator

A tiny CLI program that asks for a bill amount, preferred tip, and number of people and outputs the amount owed for each person

## Notes 
- For readability, numeric literals can use underscores: `1_000_000`.
- Math operators:
  - `**` = exponentiation
  - `//` = floor division (rounds down toward negative infinity), unlike `/` which returns a float
- f-strings are handy for formatting output with variables: `f"{value:.2f}"`


## Run
From the repo root: 

```bash
python day02/main.py
```
